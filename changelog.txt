login/notification and profile buttons will now shift left depending on size and dropdown menu size
remains static.

and look like actual buttons

- Improved animation for profile dropdown menu to drop down each individual button instead
of doing a static "window wipe" animation for all three buttons. Changed button size and shape.
- Successfully completed smooth scroll upon using arrow keys (up and down) to navigate
- Improved smooth scrolling system by mimicking mouse scroll behavior
(first scroll down goes exactly under banner, next scrolls are 2x larger increments,
- Moved navigation bar to left side instead of centered
- Note: attempt screen scaling (when the window is smaller, since most the site's elements
do not work well with changed size and resolutions)
